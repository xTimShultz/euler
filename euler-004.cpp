// A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from
// the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

// Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
//
// Assume that the largest palindrome will be a 6-digit number.
// The largest 6-digit palindrome is 999999. The smallest is 100001
//
// So, we will start with forming palindromes by mirroring their
// 3-digit countersparts like 999 -> 999999, starting with the largest.
// This will give us a palindrome to solve for and a single factor.
// 
// We'll use another loop to find a second factor that produces the palindrome as
// a product. If we get a match, then we're done, since we start with the largest
// palindromes and work backwards to find their 3-digit factors.
//
// e.g. 999 (factor)
