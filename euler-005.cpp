// 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the
// numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

// What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible
// by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
//
// Solution by Tim Shultz, September 2021
//
// Given the problem statement, we will start our search at 2520 and 
// increase by 20, since a candidate number must be divisible by
// 20 anyway, and this will optimize the search.
// 
// Since all numbers are divisible by 1, we will skip that as well.
// Will skip 2 for testing even divisors and the test
// for 20, since our increment of candidate numbers chooses numbers
// divisible by 20.
//
// Algorith will iteratively test 2520 + n*20 against {3..19}.
//
// Note that additional optimizations are possible, since for example,
// numbers divisible 3 don't need to be tested if they are also divisible by 6.
// However, the solution below proves sufficiently fast for now.
